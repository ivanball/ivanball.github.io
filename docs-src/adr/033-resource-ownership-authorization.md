# ADR-033: Resource-Ownership Authorization (Row-Level + Action Filter)

## Status
Accepted (2026-07-02).

## Context
ADR-020 added a permission (capability) layer over RBAC: it answers "what may this **role** do",
resolving a role to a permission so an endpoint can require a capability instead of a role name. It
explicitly scoped out the orthogonal question, "is this **my** order", recording that "per-resource
ownership (a customer may read only their own data) stays a separate concern (`OwnerOrAdminFilter`),
and a route needing both composes the two" (`ADRs/020-permission-based-authorization.md:72`,
`020-permission-based-authorization.md:73`).

That carve-out names a mechanism that already ships in framework code but had no decision record of
its own. RBAC and permissions are principal-scoped: a customer with the Customer role may read orders,
but that role says nothing about *which* orders. Two endpoint shapes need a different, resource-scoped
check that the role/permission model cannot express:

- **Single-resource routes** (`GET /orders/{id}`, `GET /customers/{id}`): the id in the URL identifies
  one resource, and a non-admin caller must be denied if that resource is not theirs.
- **Collection/list routes** (`GET /orders`, `GET /shoppingcarts`): there is no id to check; the result
  set itself must be narrowed to the caller's own rows rather than returning everyone's data.

These are different problems (reject-one vs filter-many) and cannot be one mechanism. This ADR records
the shipped resource-ownership axis that sits beside ADR-020, not inside it.

## Decision
Provide a row/resource-level ownership axis in `MMCA.Common.API` (the `Authorization` folder), with two
enforcement points keyed on the caller's owner claim (`customer_id` by default) and a configurable
bypass role (`Admin` by default).

- **Single-resource action filter.** `OwnerOrAdminFilter`
  (`Source/Presentation/MMCA.Common.API/Authorization/OwnerOrAdminFilter.cs:20`) is a sealed
  `IAsyncActionFilter` whose primary constructor takes `ICurrentUserService` and
  `IOptions<OwnerOrAdminFilterOptions>`. Its ownership vocabulary comes from
  `OwnerOrAdminFilterOptions`
  (`Source/Presentation/MMCA.Common.API/Authorization/OwnerOrAdminFilterOptions.cs:11`), whose defaults
  reproduce the original hard-coded behavior: `OwnerClaimType` `"customer_id"`
  (`OwnerOrAdminFilterOptions.cs:14`), `BypassRole` `"Admin"` (`OwnerOrAdminFilterOptions.cs:17`), and
  `OwnerParameterName` `"id"` (`OwnerOrAdminFilterOptions.cs:24`), so a host that configures nothing
  behaves exactly as before. It short-circuits to the action for the bypass role
  (`OwnershipHelper.IsAdmin(currentUserService, settings.BypassRole)`, `OwnerOrAdminFilter.cs:32`);
  otherwise it reads the caller's owner claim via `GetClaimValue<int>(settings.OwnerClaimType)`
  (`OwnerOrAdminFilter.cs:38`) and returns `ForbidResult` (HTTP 403) if the claim is missing
  (`OwnerOrAdminFilter.cs:40`, `OwnerOrAdminFilter.cs:42`) or if the requested owner parameter resolves
  to an int that does not equal the claim (`OwnerOrAdminFilter.cs:46`, `OwnerOrAdminFilter.cs:49`).
  `TryGetOwnerParameter` reads that parameter from a **route value**
  (`/customers/{id}`) or, when the route lacks it, from a **model-bound query/body argument**
  (`?userId=42`), so the guard also covers list/query routes that carry the owner as a bound
  argument, not only route ids. It is registered scoped by `AddAPI`
  (`Source/Presentation/MMCA.Common.API/DependencyInjection.cs:68`) and applied per controller as
  `[ServiceFilter(typeof(OwnerOrAdminFilter))]`.
- **Collection ownership specification.** `OwnershipHelper`
  (`Source/Presentation/MMCA.Common.API/Authorization/OwnershipHelper.cs:10`) is a static helper.
  `GetOwnershipSpecification<TSpec, TId>` returns `null` for the bypass role (`OwnershipHelper.cs:45`),
  and otherwise reads the caller's id claim (`GetClaimValue<TId>(claimType)`, `OwnershipHelper.cs:50`)
  and builds a `Specification` via the supplied factory (`OwnershipHelper.cs:51`); a convenience
  overload defaults the claim to `"customer_id"` (`OwnershipHelper.cs:63`, `OwnershipHelper.cs:67`). The
  returned spec is a `Specification<TEntity, TId>` (`Source/Core/MMCA.Common.Domain/Specifications/Specification.cs:15`)
  whose `Criteria` expression (`Specification.cs:23`) the existing query pipeline (`IEntityQueryService`)
  translates to SQL, so a non-admin list query returns only the caller's rows. A `null` spec (bypass
  role) applies no filter.
- **The bypass role is the single override on both.** `OwnershipHelper.IsAdmin`
  (`Source/Presentation/MMCA.Common.API/Authorization/OwnershipHelper.cs:17`) compares
  `ICurrentUserService.Role` (`Source/Core/MMCA.Common.Application/Interfaces/Infrastructure/ICurrentUserService.cs:18`)
  to its `bypassRole` argument (`"Admin"` by default) case-insensitively (`OwnershipHelper.cs:20`). Both
  enforcement points consult it, so a caller in the bypass role sees and touches any resource through
  either path.
- **The filter denies by default.** When the owner parameter cannot be resolved (absent, non-int, or
  carried inside a bound model whose `ToString()` does not parse), the request is rejected. The
  filter originally fell through to the action in that case, which meant it silently stopped
  guarding any action whose parameter was optional or not an int: "nothing to compare" was being
  read as "nothing to enforce". An action that legitimately has no owner parameter opts out with
  `[AllowMissingOwner]`
  (`Source/Presentation/MMCA.Common.API/Authorization/AllowMissingOwnerAttribute.cs`), honored on the
  action or its controller through the endpoint metadata. The attribute is an assertion that the
  action is guarded some other way, so each application site must name that guard: an ownership
  specification that already narrows the rows, or its own authorization policy. The opt-out excuses
  only a *missing* parameter; an action carrying a foreign owner id is still denied, and a missing
  owner claim is still denied regardless.
- **Two failure shapes, by design.** The single-resource filter denies with 403 (`ForbidResult`); the
  collection path never 403s, it returns a filtered (possibly empty) result set. Both flow through the
  caller's normal `Result`/HTTP edge (ADR-013), not exceptions.

**Applying the filter at controller level covers every action on that controller**, including ones
inherited from `EntityControllerBase` / `AggregateRootEntityControllerBase`. Adding it is therefore an
audit of the whole controller, not just of the routes that motivated it.

**Adoption.** MMCA.Store wires both in production. The filter guards
`MMCA.Store/.../Sales.API/Controllers/ShoppingCartsController.cs:38` and
`MMCA.Store/.../Identity.API/Controllers/CustomersController.cs:32` as a `[ServiceFilter]`. The
ownership specification scopes list/get queries:
`ShoppingCartsController` builds a `ShoppingCartByCustomerSpecification`
(`MMCA.Store/.../Sales.API/Controllers/ShoppingCartsController.cs:53`,
`MMCA.Store/.../Sales.Application/ShoppingCarts/Specifications/ShoppingCartByCustomerSpecification.cs:19`,
which filters by `Id` because a cart is keyed by customer, `ShoppingCartByCustomerSpecification.cs:23`)
and `OrdersController` builds an `OrdersByCustomerSpecification`
(`MMCA.Store/.../Sales.API/Controllers/OrdersController.cs:53`,
`MMCA.Store/.../Sales.Application/Orders/Specifications/OrdersByCustomerSpecification.cs:13`, filtering
by `CustomerId`, `OrdersByCustomerSpecification.cs:17`), passing it into each query (for example
`OrdersController.cs:68`). `OrdersController` does not use the class-level filter for its mutating
routes; it runs an explicit per-mutation ownership check, `ValidateOwnershipAsync`
(`OrdersController.cs:293`), that reuses `OwnershipHelper.IsAdmin` (`OrdersController.cs:51`) and
deliberately returns **404 NotFound** rather than 403 so it does not reveal that another customer's
order exists (`OrdersController.cs:291`, `OrdersController.cs:316`).

MMCA.ADC's Engagement module is the first host to configure the filter's vocabulary rather than take
the defaults. `AddModuleEngagementAPI`
(`MMCA.ADC/Source/Modules/Engagement/MMCA.ADC.Engagement.API/DependencyInjection.cs:42`) calls
`services.Configure<OwnerOrAdminFilterOptions>(...)` (`DependencyInjection.cs:44`) to point the shared
filter at ADC's own ownership terms: the `user_id` claim its token service emits
(`DependencyInjection.cs:46`), the `Organizer` bypass role (`RoleNames.Organizer`,
`Source/Core/MMCA.Common.Shared/Auth/RoleNames.cs:15`, `DependencyInjection.cs:47`), and the `userId`
query argument its Bookmarks list endpoints bind (`DependencyInjection.cs:48`). The filter type is
unchanged; only the options differ, which is exactly what the options object exists for. The Bookmarks
**delete** keeps a separate DB-backed inline ownership check that returns 404-not-403 (the same
per-mutation, existence-hiding pattern Store's `OrdersController` uses).

**The deny-by-default audit.** Both Store controllers apply the filter at class level, so every action
on them was reviewed and the ones with no owner parameter now carry `[AllowMissingOwner]` with the
guard that replaces the check named at each site:

| Action | Guard that replaces the parameter check |
| --- | --- |
| `ShoppingCartsController.GetAllAsync` (both overloads) | `ShoppingCartByCustomerSpecification` already narrows the rows to the caller |
| `ShoppingCartsController.GetAllForLookupAsync` | `RequireAdmin` policy |
| `CustomersController.GetAllAsync` (both overloads), `GetAllForLookupAsync` | `RequireAdmin` policy |

`CustomersController.CreateAsync` was inherited without its own policy and had been relying on the
filter failing open. Deny-by-default closes that, but only incidentally, because the action happens to
carry no owner parameter; it is now explicitly `RequireAdmin`, matching the Admin-gated create page
that is its only caller. ADC's `BookmarksController` needs no annotation: both filtered actions bind a
`[Required]` non-nullable `userId`, so model validation rejects a missing value before the filter runs.

## Rationale
- **Reject-one and filter-many are genuinely two mechanisms.** A single-resource route has an id to
  compare, so a short action filter that 403s on a mismatch is the cheapest correct guard. A collection
  route has no id; narrowing it means pushing a predicate into the query, which a filter cannot do
  without re-running the query itself. Forcing both through one abstraction would either over-fetch then
  post-filter (leaky, and breaks paging counts) or fail to scope lists at all.
- **Ownership lives beside RBAC, not inside it.** Role/permission resolution (ADR-020) is a property of
  the principal; ownership is a relation between the principal and a specific row. Keeping them separate
  lets a route compose both (require a capability *and* own the resource) without either model growing a
  resource-condition concept it was not designed for.
- **A `Specification` composes with the existing pipeline.** The row-scope is expressed as a
  `Specification<TEntity, TId>` whose `Criteria` is an EF-translatable expression
  (`Specification.cs:9`, `Specification.cs:23`), so it slots into `IEntityQueryService` alongside
  filtering, sorting, paging, and projection (and can be `And`-composed with other specs,
  `Specification.cs:62`) rather than introducing a parallel query path.

## Trade-offs
- **Opt-in per controller/handler.** Neither point is automatic: a controller that forgets the
  `[ServiceFilter]` or omits the ownership spec from a query leaks across customers, the same
  audit-the-inventory caveat as ADR-019 / ADR-020 / ADR-021. The two-enforcement-point split also means
  one route can guard mutations but forget to scope its list (or vice versa).
- **Claim-based ownership trusts the token.** Both points key on the configured owner claim
  (`customer_id` by default) being present and correct, so their correctness depends entirely on the
  upstream token validation (ADR-004); a missing claim 403s (filter) or yields a `null` spec (helper,
  which for a non-admin returns `null` and therefore no scoping, so callers must not treat a missing
  claim as "admin").
- **The filter assumes the owner parameter equals the owning id.** `OwnerOrAdminFilter` compares its
  configured owner parameter, resolved from either a route value or a model-bound argument, against the
  configured owner claim (`OwnerOrAdminFilter.cs:46`). That holds where the resource is keyed by the
  owner (the cart, the customer profile, a user's own bookmarks) but not where a resource has a separate
  id and a foreign-key owner; those (orders) need the spec or an explicit per-id check instead.
- **This is ownership, not ABAC.** It answers "is this row mine" against a single id claim with an admin
  override; it does not evaluate arbitrary resource attributes, hierarchies, or delegated access. A
  richer policy would be a different mechanism, not a parameter on this one.

`020-permission-based-authorization.md:72` scope-out this fills), ADR-034 (the generic entity query
pipeline / `IEntityQueryService` the collection-scoping `Specification` slots into), ADR-013 (failures

principal and owner claim both enforcement points trust).
