# ADR-041: Observability and Telemetry Strategy

## Status
Accepted (2026-07-10). Amended (2026-07-23) to document the `Telemetry:DisableHttpClientMetrics` and
`Telemetry:DisableRuntimeMetrics` cost knobs and to correct the meter/activity-source literal
citations.

## Context
The framework is a modular monolith whose modules extract into standalone services (ADR-008), so
the same telemetry has to make sense whether a request stays in one process or crosses a gateway and
several service hosts. OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation (ASP.NET Core, `HttpClient`, the .NET
runtime) gives generic HTTP and runtime signals for free, but it is blind to the two paths that carry
almost all of the framework's own work: the CQRS use-case pipeline (ADR-014) and the outbox
(ADR-003). "How long is this command taking and how often does it fail" and "is the outbox
dead-lettering" are not questions auto-instrumentation can answer.

Two cost forces pull the other way. A deployed fleet polls every relational outbox around the clock,
so idle poll spans would dominate Application Insights ingestion if exported, and full-fidelity
tracing is the single largest observability line item. The framework needs custom instrumentation
where auto-instrumentation is blind, plus knobs that cut telemetry cost without going dark. This
cross-cutting observability decision was implemented but named by no existing ADR; this record
captures it.

## Decision
Standardize telemetry in the shared Aspire service defaults, add framework-specific instrumentation
for the CQRS and outbox paths, and expose cost knobs with fail-safe defaults.

- **One shared telemetry baseline on every host.** `ConfigureOpenTelemetry`
  (`Source/Hosting/MMCA.Common.Aspire/Extensions.cs:121`) wires OpenTelemetry logging with formatted
  messages and scopes (`Extensions.cs:125`), metrics from ASP.NET Core (unconditional,
  `Extensions.cs:132`) plus `HttpClient` and the runtime (each gated behind a cost knob, see below),
  and tracing from ASP.NET Core and `HttpClient` (`Extensions.cs:164`). It is
  called from `AddServiceDefaults` (`Extensions.cs:41`), so a host opts in once and every project in
  the Aspire model inherits the same pipeline.

- **Custom RED metrics from the CQRS pipeline.** A single meter `MMCA.Common.Cqrs`
  (`Source/Core/MMCA.Common.Application/UseCases/Decorators/CqrsMetrics.cs:15`) publishes two duration
  histograms: `cqrs.command.duration` (`CqrsMetrics.cs:20`) and `cqrs.query.duration`
  (`CqrsMetrics.cs:26`), both in milliseconds. The logging decorators record them in a `finally` so
  every path is measured: `CqrsMetrics.CommandDuration.Record(...)` tagged by `command` and `outcome`
  (`Source/Core/MMCA.Common.Application/UseCases/Decorators/LoggingCommandDecorator.cs:58`) and the
  query equivalent (`Source/Core/MMCA.Common.Application/UseCases/Decorators/LoggingQueryDecorator.cs:59`).
  The `outcome` tag takes `completed`, `failed` (a `Result` failure), or `exception`
  (`LoggingCommandDecorator.cs:30`, `:38`, `:52`), so count gives rate, the tag gives errors, and the
  histogram gives duration. The Aspire host subscribes the meter by literal name
  (`Extensions.cs:158`).

- **An outbox dead-letter counter.** The outbox processor owns a meter `MMCA.Common.Outbox`
  (`Source/Core/MMCA.Common.Infrastructure/Persistence/Outbox/OutboxProcessor.cs:62`) and a counter
  `outbox.dead_letter.count` (`OutboxProcessor.cs:63`), incremented with an `event_type` tag whenever
  a message is dead-lettered because its type cannot be resolved (`OutboxProcessor.cs:348`). The same
  source emits outbox spans (`OutboxProcessor.cs:61`); both the meter and the trace source are
  registered by literal name in the Aspire defaults (`Extensions.cs:157`, `Extensions.cs:163`).

- **Correlation-ID middleware ties the request together.** `CorrelationIdMiddleware`
  (`Source/Presentation/MMCA.Common.API/Middleware/CorrelationIdMiddleware.cs:15`) uses the
  `X-Correlation-ID` header (`CorrelationIdMiddleware.cs:18`), reading it from the request or falling
  back to the current W3C trace id and then to `HttpContext.TraceIdentifier`
  (`CorrelationIdMiddleware.cs:32`), sets it on the scoped `ICorrelationContext`
  (`CorrelationIdMiddleware.cs:36`), and echoes it on the response
  (`CorrelationIdMiddleware.cs:37`). The CQRS logging decorators stamp that same id into every log
  scope (`LoggingCommandDecorator.cs:23`, `:25`), so logs, the correlation id, and the trace id line
  up for one request.

- **Two high-volume metric families gated behind cost knobs, on by default.** ASP.NET Core metrics are
  always wired (`Extensions.cs:132`), but the two heaviest AppMetrics contributors on a low-traffic
  multi-service deployment are conditional. `HttpClient` connection and request metrics are added only
  when `Telemetry:DisableHttpClientMetrics` is unset or false (`Extensions.cs:141`, adding
  instrumentation at `Extensions.cs:143`), and .NET runtime metrics (`dotnet.gc.*`, `jit.*`,
  `thread_pool.*`) only when `Telemetry:DisableRuntimeMetrics` is unset or false (`Extensions.cs:150`,
  adding at `Extensions.cs:152`). Both keys are read by `IsInstrumentationDisabled`
  (`Extensions.cs:350`), which drops the family only when the value parses as boolean `true`; absent,
  blank, or unparseable falls back to keeping the instrumentation, so a typo cannot silently blind a
  whole metric family. A deployed host sets one or both to `true` to cut ingestion cost; outbound
  dependency latency is still captured as traces when `HttpClient` metrics are dropped.

- **Head-based sampling as a cost knob, off by default.** `Telemetry:TracesSampleRatio`
  (`Extensions.cs:179`, parsed by `TryGetTraceSampleRatio` at `Extensions.cs:327`) is unset by
  default, so a host samples everything and behavior does not change. A deployed host sets a ratio in
  the open interval (0,1) to keep that fraction of traces; the value wraps a `TraceIdRatioBasedSampler`
  in a `ParentBasedSampler` (`Extensions.cs:180`) so a sampled-in request keeps its whole trace across
  service boundaries. A key that is absent, unparseable, or outside (0,1) falls back to sample-all
  (`Extensions.cs:331`), so a typo can never silently drop all telemetry.

- **Outbox poll spans are filtered out of export.** `OutboxPollFilterProcessor`
  (`Source/Hosting/MMCA.Common.Aspire/Telemetry/OutboxPollFilterProcessor.cs:15`), registered before
  the exporters (`Extensions.cs:172`), clears the `Recorded` flag on the recurring `OutboxPoll` span
  and its children (`OutboxPollFilterProcessor.cs:42`). The poll query runs inside that span
  (`OutboxProcessor.cs:266`, named at `OutboxProcessor.cs:56`), so steady-state polling does not flood
  Application Insights. Real outbox work is untouched: each per-message `OutboxProcess` span is started
  under an explicit parent context restored from the message's stored trace and span ids
  (`OutboxProcessor.cs:416`), so it is never a child of the poll span.

- **Dual exporters, either or both.** `AddOpenTelemetryExporters` enables OTLP when
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is present (`Extensions.cs:250`, the Aspire dashboard sets it) and
  Azure Monitor via `UseAzureMonitor` when `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` is present
  (`Extensions.cs:258`, set by the cloud deployment). Both can be active at once
  (`Extensions.cs:245`), so local development ships to the Aspire dashboard and production ships to
  workspace-based Application Insights with no code change.

## Rationale
- **Instrument only where auto-instrumentation is blind.** The CQRS RED histograms and the outbox
  dead-letter counter cover the two framework-owned hot paths; everything else (HTTP, runtime) rides
  the free auto-instrumentation, so the custom surface stays small.
- **RED at the decorator, not in every handler.** The CQRS pipeline already wraps every handler in a
  logging decorator (ADR-014), so recording duration and outcome there makes metrics a byproduct of a
  pipeline layer that exists, with no per-handler discipline (the invariant-over-discipline posture, ADR-015).
- **A single correlation id with a W3C fallback.** Whether or not a client supplies
  `X-Correlation-ID`, one id stitches the logs of a request together and matches the trace, which is
  what an operator needs first when a distributed call goes wrong.
- **Cost knobs default to safe.** Sampling, poll-span filtering, and the `HttpClient`/runtime metric
  toggles are the levers a FinOps owner reaches for (COST.md), and all fail toward keeping data:
  sampling is off unless configured, an out-of-range ratio is ignored, only idle poll spans are
  dropped, and a metric family drops only on an explicit boolean `true` (a typo keeps it on).
- **`ParentBased` keeps distributed traces coherent.** An extracted-service deployment (ADR-008) needs
  a sampled-in request to stay sampled end to end; a per-hop random sampler would shred cross-service
  traces.

## Trade-offs
- **Custom instrumentation carries a maintenance cost.** The Aspire package has no reference to
  Application or Infrastructure by design, so the meter and activity-source names are duplicated as
  literals (the meter subscriptions at `Extensions.cs:155`-`Extensions.cs:158` and the trace source at
  `Extensions.cs:163`, and the sync notes at `CqrsMetrics.cs:8` and
  `OutboxPollFilterProcessor.cs:17`). A rename on one side silently stops export until the literal is
  updated. That is the price of the decoupled package graph.
- **Sampling trades trace completeness for cost.** A sampled-out trace is simply gone; deep debugging
  of a specific request can miss it. Metrics and logs are unaffected (sampling is trace-only), so RED
  rates and error counts stay whole even at a low ratio.
- **Poll-span filtering hides steady-state outbox activity.** The dead-letter counter and per-message
  `OutboxProcess` spans remain, but "is the poller alive and looping" cannot be answered from traces
  alone, by design (that signal is metrics and the dead-letter counter, not spans).
- **Cross-service trace continuity depends on stored ids and the parent decision.** A linked
  `OutboxProcess` trace only reconnects when the producer captured the trace and span ids on the
  message; `ParentBased` sampling that dropped the originating trace also drops the linked span.
- **Exporters and sampling are opt-in per host.** A host that sets neither exporter variable emits to
  nothing, and a misconfigured ratio fails toward sample-all (higher cost) rather than toward silence:
  the intended bias, but it means a cost surprise is possible where a data gap is not.
